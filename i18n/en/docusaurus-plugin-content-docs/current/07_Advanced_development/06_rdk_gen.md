## 7.6.1 Overview
This chapter mainly introduces customization of the RDK build system. For rdk_gen usage, refer to the README.md in the rdk_gen repository.

Basic usage:
``` bash
# Online image build: download dependent deb packages from D-Robotics and third-party APT sources
sudo ./pack_image.sh

# Offline image build: install only deb packages under out/product/deb_packages. When using this option, ensure deb packages in out/product/deb_packages meet expectations, and a prebuilt root filesystem package exists under out/product/rootfs_packages
sudo ./pack_image.sh -l

# Set up deb build environment only, without packing an image
sudo ./pack_images.sh -p

# Build all deb packages
./mk_debs.sh

# Build a specific deb package, e.g. hobot-configs
./mk_debs.sh hobot-configs
```

## 7.6.2 Root Filesystem Prebuilt Package Build Guide
The root filesystem is built with multistrap + chroot.

### multistrap
#### Official Documentation
  - [Debian Wiki | Multistrap](https://wiki.debian.org/Multistrap)
  - [Debian manpage](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/multistrap/multistrap.1.en.html)

#### Tool Overview
In summary, `multistrap` is another tool (independent of `debootstrap`) for generating root filesystems based on APT sources for Debian/Ubuntu and similar systems. It uses one or more configuration files to define the APT sources used to generate the root filesystem and which packages are installed by default.
The main differences from `debootstrap` are:
1. Flexibility: `multistrap` allows users to fully customize all packages in the newly generated root filesystem, including packages marked as required in the APT source, but users must ensure root filesystem integrity and usability themselves;
2. Build flow: unlike `debootstrap`, the `multistrap` build flow can be summarized as follows. The biggest difference is step 4: `multistrap` only unpacks packages and does not configure them (i.e., it does not run [pre/post]install scripts):
  1. Read configuration files
  2. Fetch metadata from specified APT sources according to the configuration
  3. Download specified packages according to the configuration
  4. Unpack specified packages according to the configuration
In the `multistrap` build scripts provided by D-Robotics, based on practical experience, we use `binfmt-support + chroot` under sudo to configure packages so that the root filesystem you build can be flashed directly to the board.

#### Configuration File Overview
`multistrap` configuration files support single-file and multi-file formats. In multi-file mode, you can use the "include" field to include all content from a base version and then configure only the specific variant, which greatly simplifies maintenance of multiple filesystems.
Configuration files referenced in the following sections are under: `samplefs/configs`:
```bash
$ tree samplefs/configs/
samplefs/configs/
├── jammy-base.conf
├── jammy-desktop.conf
├── jammy-server.conf
├── noble-base.conf
├── noble-desktop.conf
└── pip-requirements.list

0 directories, 6 files
```

:::info Platform Selection
- **RDK S100**: Use `jammy-*` configuration files (Ubuntu 22.04)
- **RDK S600**: Use `noble-*` configuration files (Ubuntu 24.04)
:::

##### Basic Format
For detailed field descriptions, refer to the official documentation. This section focuses on important settings in D-Robotics configuration files.
1. Field: `key1=value1` format defines the value of field "key1" as "value1"
2. Field set (stanza/section): define "`[Some-Section]`" to group all fields from that line until the next "`[Next-Section]`" into one "`Section`"

Key fields:
- include
  - Path to configuration files to include
- bootstrap
  - Field set defining the APT source used to generate the root filesystem and packages to download and unpack
- aptsources
  - Field set defining APT sources saved under /etc/sources.list.d/ in the generated root filesystem. **Note**: this source does not have to match the source used in bootstrap to generate the root filesystem, but we strongly recommend that aptsources defines a superset of the bootstrap source.
- source/suite/components/omitdebsrc
  - Keywords for APT sources. See [APT sources.list format](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man5/sources.list.5.html)
  - source: root URL of the APT source, matching the "uri" field in APT source format
  - suite: suite of the APT source, matching the "suite" field in APT source format, generally the system code name + attribute, e.g. Ubuntu jammy/focal/noble/jammy-updates/noble-security
  - components: component of the APT source, matching the "component" field in APT source format; multiple can be added
  - omitdebsrc: when fetching APT metadata and packages, whether to download src packages corresponding to deb packages; usually set to "true" (do not download src packages) to speed up builds.
- packages
  - Field for defining packages to fetch. One packages field can define multiple packages separated by spaces. The union of all packages fields is the final package list.
##### Multi-File Configuration Example

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<DocScope products="RDK S100">
Refer to code path `samplefs/configs/jammy-desktop.conf`
</DocScope>
<DocScope products="RDK S600">
Refer to code path `samplefs/configs/noble-desktop.conf`
</DocScope>

### RDK Implementation
#### Configuration File Design
On RDK, multistrap configuration files are divided by platform by default:

<DocScope products="RDK S100">

- jammy-base.conf: common default root filesystem configuration for RDK S100, including APT sources and packages included by default in all RDK S100 variants;
- jammy-desktop.conf: additional packages for RDK S100 desktop root filesystem based on jammy-base.conf;
- jammy-server.conf: additional packages for RDK S100 server root filesystem based on jammy-base.conf;

</DocScope>
<DocScope products="RDK S600">

- noble-base.conf: common default root filesystem configuration for RDK S600, including APT sources and packages included by default in all RDK S600 variants;
- noble-desktop.conf: additional packages for RDK S600 desktop root filesystem based on noble-base.conf;
</DocScope>

#### Build Flow
Users generally use the `samplefs/make_ubuntu_samplefs.sh` script to build the root filesystem. If the script is invoked with sudo, package configuration is included and build time increases significantly.

If the script is invoked without sudo, package configuration is skipped and build time is shorter, but on first boot on the board you must run `rm -rf /var/lock/* ; dpkg --configure -a --force-confdef --force-confold ; systemctl enable /etc/systemd/system/S*.service` to initialize the system and reboot to ensure normal operation.

:::info **Note**
It is **recommended to use sudo** when invoking samplefs/make_ubuntu_samplefs.sh.
:::

The `samplefs/make_ubuntu_samplefs.sh` script must be run from the samplefs directory.

When invoked without arguments as `sudo ./make_ubuntu_samplefs.sh`:

<DocScope products="RDK S100">

The script builds the desktop image by default, using `jammy-desktop.conf` to build the root filesystem.

</DocScope>
<DocScope products="RDK S600">

The script builds the desktop image by default, using `noble-desktop.conf` to build the root filesystem.

</DocScope>

To specify a configuration file: `sudo ./make_ubuntu_samplefs.sh build <config_file_name>`. For example, if the new configuration file is `new-desktop.conf`, run: `sudo ./make_ubuntu_samplefs.sh build new-desktop.conf`. Place `new-desktop.conf` under `samplefs/configs`.

#### Trimming / Customizing the Root Filesystem
:::info Note
The Priority field in APT sources (deb package control information) affects trimming/customization flow.
multistrap installs all packages with Priority "Required" by default.
D-Robotics also installs packages marked as important.
:::

##### Trim/customize only packages whose APT priority is not "important"/"required"

<DocScope products="RDK S100">

Remove unwanted packages directly from the "packages" fields in samplefs/configs/jammy-base.conf and similar files, or define a new field set and replace the original field set in the "bootstrap" field of the "[General]" field set with your own.

</DocScope>
<DocScope products="RDK S600">

</DocScope>

##### Trim/customize packages whose APT priority is "important"/"required"
**Note**: APT maintainers generally mark the minimum set of packages for a system (each Ubuntu/Debian release) as "Required", but further trimming is possible. When trimming to this extent, users must **ensure root filesystem integrity and usability themselves**.

Steps:
1. Add `omitrequired=true` in the `[General]` field set;
2. Define all packages to add in `Packages`.

## 7.6.3 RDK deb Package Build Flow
### Overview
RDK manages D-Robotics customized user-space features as deb packages by default. Source code for building all customized deb packages is under the SDK source/ directory.

### Build Script
The entry script for building deb packages is `mk_debs.sh` at the SDK root. Use it to build deb packages in the repository.

### deb Package Source Directory
Under `source`, all directories except `bootloader`, `kernel`, and `hobot-drivers` contain source for D-Robotics customized deb packages. Directories such as `hobot-spdev`, `hobot-camera`, and `hobot-io` contain source for corresponding libraries; when mk_debs.sh builds these packages, the source is compiled.
Basic structure of a deb package source directory (using hobot-configs as an example):
```bash
hobot-configs/
├── LICENSE          # License for deb package source
├── README.md        # Brief description of the deb package
├── VERSION          # Version in major.minor.patch form; timestamp added at build time by default
└── debian           # Root directory of the deb package, equivalent to root on the board
    ├── DEBIAN       # deb package metadata
    |   ├── postinst # Standard deb script, runs after dpkg copy step during install
    │   ├── postrm   # Standard deb script, runs after dpkg file removal during uninstall
    │   ├── preinst  # Standard deb script, runs before dpkg copy step during install
    │   └── prerm    # Standard deb script, runs before dpkg file removal during uninstall
    ├── etc          # Files to copy into the root filesystem as needed. Paths relative to "debian" map to paths on the root filesystem, e.g. this directory is installed to /etc on the board
    ├── lib          # Files to copy into the root filesystem as needed.
    └── usr          # Files to copy into the root filesystem as needed.
```

For deb packages that include source code, a source directory is added outside debian, e.g. hobot-camera:
```bash
hobot-camera/
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── VERSION
├── debian
│   ├── DEBIAN
│   ├── etc
│   └── usr
├── drivers             # Source directory to compile
│   ├── Makefile        # Entry Makefile for compilation
│   ├── deserial        # Source subdirectory
│   ├── inc
│   └── sensor
├── lib -> ../hobot-multimedia/debian/usr/hobot/lib # Symlink for convenient compilation
├── sensor_calibration       # Sensor tuning libraries; examples below, actual set may vary
│   └── lib_imx219_linear.so
└── tuning_tool              # D-Robotics Sensor tuning tool
    ├── bin
    ├── cfg
    ├── control_tool
    ├── res
    └── scripts
```
### Build Flow
For details, refer to the `mk_debs.sh` implementation. Simplified flow:
<img src="https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/07_Advanced_development/06_rdk_gen/mk_debs_flowchart-en.jpg" alt="mk_debs_flowchart" style={{ width: '100%' }} />

### Custom deb Package Flow
1. Under `source/`, create a folder named after the package name (dpkg package name), e.g. "new_package";
2. Under `source/new_package`, create a `debian` folder with four script files (they may be empty):
    - preinst: runs before copying files when installing new_package;
    - postinst: runs after copy completes when installing new_package;
    - prerm: runs before removal when uninstalling new_package;
    - postrm: runs after removal when uninstalling new_package.
3. To build this package automatically when `mk_debs.sh` is run without arguments, add `new_package` to the `deb_pkg_list` variable in `mk_debs.sh`;
4. In the `switch` of the `make_debian_deb` function in `mk_debs.sh`, add a `case` for `new_package`:
     - Call `gen_control_file` in the `case` to generate the control file needed to build the deb;
     - Use `sed` in the `case` to replace the default "depends" field with actual deb dependencies. If `new_package` depends on `dep_pkg1` and `dep_pkg2`:
       - With dependencies: `sed -i 's/Depends: .*$/Depends: dep_pkg1,dep_pkg2/' "${deb_dst_dir}"/DEBIAN/control;`
       - Without dependencies: `sed -i 's/Depends: .*$/Depends: /' "${deb_dst_dir}"/DEBIAN/control;`
     - (Optional) If source must be compiled before packing, invoke compile commands; all output must go under `out/build/debs/new_pkg/debian/`;
     - Set `is_allowed=1`

## 7.6.4 Including deb Packages in the Image
During image build, deb packages are integrated into the board root filesystem.

### Online Image Build
#### Flow
When `pack_image.sh` is invoked without the `-l` option, the online image build flow runs:
1. Read the default build config from `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `pack_image.sh`, e.g. S100: `build_params/ubuntu-22.04_desktop_rdk-s100_release.conf`, S600: `build_params/ubuntu-24.04_desktop_rdk-s600_release.conf`;
     - Override with the `-c` option
2. Read `RDK_DPKG_DEB_PKG_LIST` from the build config;
3. chroot into `out/deploy/rootfs`:
   1. Download all deb packages listed in `RDK_DPKG_DEB_PKG_LIST` from board APT sources;
   2. Install all deb packages;

#### Adding Extra deb Packages
1. Find the package name to install;
2. Add the package name to `RDK_DPKG_DEB_PKG_LIST` in the chosen build config.

:::info Note
See [How to Get Required deb Package Names](#get_package_name) for finding package names.
:::

### Offline Image Build
#### Flow
When `pack_image.sh` is invoked with `-l`, the offline image build flow runs:
1. chroot:
   1. Install each deb package present under `out/product/deb_packages`;

#### Adding Extra deb Packages
1. Find the package name to install;
2. Download packages to `out/product/deb_packages`:
```bash
cd out/product/deb_packages
apt download <package names>
```

:::info Note
See [How to Get Required deb Package Names](#get_package_name) for finding package names.
:::

### How to Get Required deb Package Names{#get_package_name}
Package names can be obtained in two ways:
1. You know the file needed and the host has not installed the package:
   - Use search engines (Google/Baidu, etc.) to find the deb package containing the file and its APT source. Example flow:
     - Search by filename under "Search the contents of packages" on [debian.org](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages);
     - After confirming the package name, search on [Ubuntu Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+search) for the source; confirm the package exists in jammy/jammy-updates (S100) or noble/noble-updates (S600) main/universe/multiverse components;
2. You know the file needed and it is installed on the host:
   - Use `dpkg -S <filename>` to get the package name.

### Default Images and Partitions
1. miniboot_flash: basic boot images on RDK Nor Flash, including HSM/MCU0 and other system components;
2. miniboot_emmc: basic boot images on RDK eMMC, including BL31/Uboot and other system components;
3. emmc_disk: full image on RDK eMMC, includes miniboot_emmc; at build time it is converted to Android Sparse image format ([Android Sparse image format (third-party reference)](https://www.2net.co.uk/tutorial/android-sparse-image-format)) to reduce storage use;

### Configuration File Description
The partition table has global shared settings and per-partition settings. Global settings are in the "global" field and apply to all partitions.
**Supported global parameters:**
- `antirollbackUpdate_host`: whether to update host anti-rollback version, true or false;
- `antirollbackUpdate_hsm`: whether to update HSM anti-rollback version, true or false;
- `ab_sync`: D-Robotics internal reserved field;
- `backup_dir`: HSM backup directory;
- `AB_part_a`: suffix for A partition in AB layout;
- `AB_part_b`: suffix for B partition in AB layout;
- `BAK_part_bak`: backup partition suffix;

Per-partition configuration uses "partition name":"partition config type". Choose the config type as needed. For example, for the boot partition, add boot in the global partition config, then create `boot.json` under the corresponding sub_config folder and define `boot_common`:

<DocScope products="RDK S100">

Create `boot.json` under `source/bootloader/device/rdk/s100/partition_config_files/sub_config`:

**Supported partition parameters:**
- `depends`: partition dependencies; list partition names that must be built before this partition;
- `components`: content for this partition: sub-image paths or directories; directories become filesystems (ext4 or fat16 supported). Use ":" after the path for size in the partition. Multiple sub-images allowed; place under out/xxx/deploy in the partition directory;
- `components_nose`: non-secure boot image components;
- `pre_cmd`: commands before building the image from components;
- `post_cmd`: commands after building the image from components;
- `fs_type`: image type: None/ext4/fat16/misc;
- `medium`: storage: emmc/nor;
- `ota_is_update`: include in full OTA package;
- `ota_update_mode`: OTA upgrade mode; image (default) or image_diff for differential;
- `is_rootfs`: whether this is the rootfs partition;
- `part_type`: AB, BAK, or PERMANENT;
- `size`: partition size; units k, m, g;
- `magic`: partition magic (flash images with header only);
- `have_anti_ver`: whether image contains anti-rollback version, true or false;
- `load_addr`: load address (flash images with header only);
- `entry_addr`: entry address (flash images with header only);
- `nose_support`: non-secure boot image support;

:::info Note
1. Partition order in the JSON file is the actual order on the board;
2. Partition size must be aligned to the sector size of the storage medium;

### Modifying Partitions

<DocScope products="RDK S100">
RDK S100 supports changing partitions on eMMC/UFS by adding, removing, or editing partition fields. For flash partitions, contact D-Robotics if changes are needed.

:::warning Partition Modification Notes
1. In the partition table, partitions through `log` are boot partitions; modifying them is not recommended in principle.
2. Other partitions such as `userdata` and `system` can be resized freely. If you add partitions, update `fstab` so they mount correctly;
:::

After modifying the partition table, apply changes as follows:
1. Build the hobot-miniboot deb package:
	```shell
	# In RDK Source Root Directory
	./mk_debs.sh hobot-miniboot
	```
2. Build the image locally:
	```shell
	# In RDK Source Root Directory
	sudo ./pack_image.sh -l
	```
## 7.6.6 eMMC/UFS/NVMe Image Build Notes
### Using D-Robotics ubuntu-22.04_desktop_rdk-s100_XXX.conf
For eMMC, UFS, and NVMe, drivers are selected via different config variables. Before building, set the build config to match your storage.

S100 example — edit both:
1. /build_params/ubuntu-22.04_desktop_rdk-s100_beta.conf
2. /build_params/ubuntu-22.04_desktop_rdk-s100_release.conf

Set `RDK_DISK_MEDIUM` to the storage type in use:

```shell
# eMMC
export RDK_DISK_MEDIUM="emmc"

# UFS
export RDK_DISK_MEDIUM="ufs"

# NVMe
export RDK_DISK_MEDIUM="nvme"
```

### Using Your Own conf File
If you write your own conf file:
1. Include `RDK_DISK_MEDIUM` and set it to the storage type in use:
```shell
# eMMC
export RDK_DISK_MEDIUM="emmc"

# UFS
export RDK_DISK_MEDIUM="ufs"

# NVMe
export RDK_DISK_MEDIUM="nvme"
```
2. Update five places in the S100 build system that reference the conf file (release example):
- `download_deb_packages.sh`:
```shell
  DEFAULT_CONFIG="${HR_LOCAL_DIR}/build_params/ubuntu-22.04_desktop_rdk-s100_release.conf"
```
- `download_samplefs.sh`:
```shell
  DEFAULT_CONFIG="${HR_LOCAL_DIR}/build_params/ubuntu-22.04_desktop_rdk-s100_release.conf"
```
- `mk_kernel.sh`:
```shell
  DEFAULT_CONFIG="${HR_LOCAL_DIR}/build_params/ubuntu-22.04_desktop_rdk-s100_release.conf"
```
- `pack_image.sh`:
```shell
  DEFAULT_CONFIG="${HR_LOCAL_DIR}/build_params/ubuntu-22.04_desktop_rdk-s100_release.conf"
```
- `mk_uboot.sh`:
```shell
  DEFAULT_CONFIG="${HR_LOCAL_DIR}/../../build_params/ubuntu-22.04_desktop_rdk-s100_release.conf"
```

### Build Flow After conf Changes
After changes, build uboot/spl, update miniboot/bootloader, and run a full build:
```shell
# From source root, build hobot-miniboot deb
./mk_debs.sh hobot-miniboot # Output: out/product/deb_packages/hobot-miniboot_4.0.Z-xxx_arm64.deb

./mk_kernel.sh # Output: out/product/deb_packages/linux-image-rdk-s100*_arm64.deb

# Build disk image
sudo ./pack_image.sh -l  # -l uses local deb packages; without -l, remote packages are used
```

:::warning NVMe Boot Notes
- NVMe boot is only supported on RDKS100 V0P6, RDKS600 V1P0, and their higher versions. [D13:D12] on the board can be set to [1:0] via DIP switches
- miniboot_flash built in NVMe mode supports NVMe boot only; miniboot_flash built in eMMC/UFS mode also supports NVMe boot
- Flash tool 1.1.10 and later supports NVMe image flashing
